However, some fans were not satisfied with the official HD edition, and decided to create their own fan-made project to enhance the game even further. The Resident Evil 4 HD Project is a mod that replaces the original textures, models, animations, and effects with high-resolution versions, while preserving the original art style and atmosphere. The project took over eight years to complete, and was finally released in February 2022.
 
The Resident Evil 4 HD Project is not a standalone game, but a mod that requires the Steam version of Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition to run. The mod is free to download from the official website[^2^], but it also requires 37 GB of extra storage space. The installation process is not very complicated, but it involves running an installer as administrator, pressing some keys, and selecting some options[^1^]. The mod also comes with an optional patch that fixes some bugs and adds some features, such as subtitles and controller support.
 
The result is a stunning improvement over the original game, with crisp and detailed textures, realistic lighting and shadows, smooth animations, and enhanced sound effects. The game looks like a modern title, but still retains its classic charm and gameplay. The mod also respects the artistic vision of the original developers, and does not alter any story elements or gameplay mechanics. The mod is compatible with all languages and regions of the game.
 
Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition MULTi5-PROPHET repack is a compressed version of the game that includes both the official HD edition and the fan-made HD project mod. It also includes some bonus content, such as costumes, weapons, and modes. The repack reduces the size of the game from 37 GB to 6.2 GB, making it easier to download and install. However, some users may experience some issues with the repack, such as missing files or corrupted data.
 
Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition MULTi5-PROPHET repack is a great way to experience one of the best games ever made in its full glory. It combines the official remaster with the fan-made mod to create a definitive version of the game that looks amazing and plays smoothly. However, users should be aware of the potential risks of using a repack, and always backup their files before installing it.

Resident Evil 4 is a game that has aged well, thanks to its innovative gameplay and memorable story. The game follows Leon S. Kennedy, a former police officer and special agent, who is sent to a rural area of Spain to rescue the president's daughter, Ashley Graham, from a mysterious cult. Along the way, he encounters hordes of infected villagers, monstrous creatures, and sinister enemies.
 
The game revolutionized the survival horror genre by introducing a third-person perspective, an over-the-shoulder camera, and a dynamic aiming system. The game also balanced action and horror elements, with tense combat scenarios, puzzles, and exploration. The game also featured a variety of weapons, items, and upgrades, as well as a merchant who sold and bought goods. The game also had several unlockable modes and extras, such as the Mercenaries mode, the Assignment Ada mode, and the Separate Ways mode.
 
Resident Evil 4 received critical acclaim and commercial success upon its release, and is widely considered one of the best games of all time. It won several awards and accolades, and influenced many other games in the genre. It also spawned several sequels and spin-offs, such as Resident Evil 5, Resident Evil 6, Resident Evil Revelations, and Resident Evil Village. The game also had several adaptations in other media, such as novels, comics, and movies.
