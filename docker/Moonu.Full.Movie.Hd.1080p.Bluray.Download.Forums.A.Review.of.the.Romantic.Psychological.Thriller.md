## Themes and Motifs
 
One of the main themes of Moonu is the contrast between love and madness. The film portrays how love can be both a source of happiness and a cause of suffering, depending on the circumstances and the mental state of the lovers. The film also shows how madness can be both a symptom of love and a result of losing it. The film explores how Ram's bipolar disorder affects his relationship with Janani, and how Janani's love for Ram drives her to the edge of sanity.
 
Another theme of Moonu is the role of fate and destiny in human lives. The film suggests that some events are predetermined and unavoidable, such as Ram's illness, Janani's pregnancy, and Ram's death. The film also implies that some choices are influenced by fate, such as Ram's decision to marry Janani, Janani's decision to stay with Ram, and Ram's decision to kill himself. The film uses various symbols and motifs to indicate the presence of fate, such as the number 3, the color red, and the song "Why This Kolaveri Di".
 
## Scenes and Dialogues
 
One of the most iconic scenes in Moonu is the one where Ram sings "Why This Kolaveri Di" in a recording studio. The song, which means "Why This Killer Rage", is a humorous and catchy expression of Ram's frustration with Janani's rejection. The song became a viral sensation on social media, and was praised for its simplicity, spontaneity, and relatability. The song also foreshadows Ram's violent tendencies and suicidal thoughts later in the film.
 
Another memorable scene in Moonu is the one where Ram reveals his bipolar disorder to Janani after their marriage. Ram tells Janani that he has been suffering from mood swings since his childhood, and that he has been taking medication to control them. He also tells her that he loves her more than anything in the world, and that he needs her support and understanding. Janani is shocked and scared by Ram's confession, but she decides to stay with him and help him cope with his condition.
