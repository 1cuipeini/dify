## How to Use the Plug-in
 
To use the plug-in, you will need to install and activate it on your computer, as well as the driver for your Kinect sensor. You can find the instructions for installing the plug-in and the driver on the official website. Once you have installed and activated the plug-in, you can launch iClone 6 and open the Device Mocap panel. You will see a list of available devices on the left side of the panel. Select Kinect Xbox One from the list and click Connect. You will see a preview of the camera feed on the right side of the panel. You can adjust the camera angle and position using the buttons below the preview window. You can also calibrate the floor level by clicking on the Floor button and following the instructions on the screen.
 
Next, you will need to select a character in iClone 6 that you want to animate using the plug-in. You can use any character from iClone 6 or import your own character from other software. Make sure that your character has a standard human skeleton with 23 bones. You can check this by opening the Edit Motion Layer panel and clicking on Edit Pose. You will see a list of bones on the left side of the panel. If your character has more or less than 23 bones, you will need to use other methods or software to convert it to a standard human skeleton.
 
Once you have selected a character, you can start capturing motions from the Kinect sensor. You can do this in two ways: live streaming or recording. Live streaming allows you to see your motions applied to your character in real time. Recording allows you to save your motions as clips that you can edit or export later. To start live streaming, click on Live button on the Device Mocap panel. You will see a green outline around your body on the camera preview window. This means that you are being tracked by the sensor. You can move around and perform any actions that you want to animate your character. To stop live streaming, click on Live button again.
 
To start recording, click on Record button on the Device Mocap panel. You will see a red outline around your body on the camera preview window. This means that you are being recorded by the sensor. You can move around and perform any actions that you want to record as clips. To stop recording, click on Record button again. You will see a list of clips on the bottom of the Device Mocap panel. You can rename, delete, or export these clips using the buttons below the list.
 
## How to Edit and Export Motions
 
After capturing motions from the Kinect sensor, you may want to edit or export them for further use. You can do this in iClone 6 using various tools and features. To edit motions, you can use the Edit Motion Layer panel or the Timeline panel. The Edit Motion Layer panel allows you to modify individual bones or body parts of your character using keyframes and curves. The Timeline panel allows you to trim, split, merge, or blend multiple clips using transitions and effects.
 
To export motions, you can use the Export menu or the Collect Clip feature. The Export menu allows you to export motions as BVH or FBX files that you can use in other software or platforms. The Collect Clip feature allows you to export motions as iMotion files that you can use in iClone 6 or other Reallusion software.
