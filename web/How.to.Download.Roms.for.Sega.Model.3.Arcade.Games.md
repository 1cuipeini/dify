Supermodel is a free and open-source emulator that can run Sega Model 3 games with high accuracy and speed.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download roms for Sega Model 3 games and how to use them with Supermodel. Roms are files that contain the data of the arcade games, and you will need them to play them on your PC. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Download Supermodel from its official website: [https://www.supermodel3.com/](https://www.supermodel3.com/). You will need to download the latest SVN build, which is updated frequently and has more features and compatibility than the older versions.
2. Extract the Supermodel files to a folder of your choice. You will see a file called supermodel.exe, which is the main executable of the emulator.
3. Download roms for Sega Model 3 games from a reliable source. You can find some of them on the Internet Archive, such as [Sega Model 3 Romset (2020)](https://archive.org/details/model-3-romset-2020) [^1^], [Sega Super Model 3 Full Rom Set](https://archive.org/details/spikeout_201812) [^2^], or [Sega Model 3 ROMs + Supermodel Emulator](https://archive.org/details/segamodel3) [^3^]. Make sure to download only the games that you own legally.
4. Extract the roms to a folder of your choice. You will see files with extensions such as .zip, .7z, or .rar. These are compressed files that contain the roms inside them. Do not unzip them, as Supermodel can read them directly.
5. Launch Supermodel by double-clicking on supermodel.exe. You will see a command prompt window that will ask you to enter a rom file name or path. You can either type the name of the rom file (for example, vf3.zip) or drag and drop it from your folder to the window.
6. Press Enter and wait for Supermodel to load the game. You might see some messages or warnings on the window, but they are normal and do not affect the gameplay.
7. Enjoy your Sega Model 3 game on your PC. You can use your keyboard or a gamepad to control the game. You can also adjust some settings such as video resolution, sound volume, input configuration, etc. by pressing the Tab key during the game.
